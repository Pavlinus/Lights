# Lights

The author is one of those Indie developers who made his first game being in the army... 

This little project with a bit of christmas atmosphere is my experimental work. 
Here you would control a miracle which turns lights on flying island's houses 
and collect other light sources to be able to get to the next level.
It is a continuous game with realtime generated levels.

The project was made on Unity engine.
